Self-reflection (and the lack of it) has a recurring theme for me in 2020. This year has been more aggressive and divisive than any other I've ever lived through. Hand in hand with the danger that people are in, self-reflection seems to be more important than ever and in short supply. Here are a few things I've been learning more about and reflecting on this year.

## Tech Bros

This is a serious problem in the slice of the software industry that I work in. The industry has collectively bet on the following premise: you should promote aggressive white tech bros with no people skills who steamroll over everyone on their way to the top, and this will be a successful strategy for your company. Double plus if you promote them into management, so they can perpetuate this strategy.

There is nothing I can say on this that hasn't already been said. Either you realize this is a problem, or you're part of it. _Even the first reactions of many white dudes who want to solve this problem is aggression._ It's easy to justify fighting fire with fire, although that doesn't fix anything. We need to stop looking for 10x engineers and start hiring people with empathy.

This problem is so deeply ingrained into white dudes that it is hard to fix... or at least that's what we say to avoid putting any effort to unwind the harm. Here are some things that I have been repeating to myself this year, that might help others:

- **Talk less.** You don't need to comment on every little thing. Appreciate that there is an entire world of experience and knowledge that you will never have, and promote those voices to be heard instead of your own. Everyone knows what tech bros already think, its the default opinion.
- The people you work with are infinitely more important than the product you're building. Act like you believe it. Your words don't mean anything.
- This is one thing you won't have handed to you, and that you're fighting the damage that's been caused, not people. You will have to learn how to recover from failure, maybe for the first time.
- It's not the responsibility of the people you might have stepped on to help you. They have to figure out how to survive around you, you can figure out how to be better.

Finally, stay humble. **You're not a saint for not being an asshole.** You don't deserve a pat on the back for doing the right thing.


## Ethics and Capitalism

There are so many non-technology related issues that humanity has faced this year. It's easy to opine on issues that you think you have no direct responsibility for. What about software though? Many developers believe that software is a force for good, but sometimes the thought stops there.

**All technology is political.** Ignoring this is saying that you are comfortable with the status quo. Enjoying that "no politics at work" policy? Same thing. Our decisions, including "non-decisions", affect people's lives. There are plenty of examples of software being used to make oppressing people easier, but its often more subtle than that.

Sure, maybe you're building some great "cryptocurrency to help nations without stable banking systems", but are you also putting out the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> as an entire nation while half of the planet is on fire, exacerbated by global warming? Maybe you're building a secure end-to-end encrypted messaging system... which also blasts out to all of your contacts that you've joined. Did we not stop to think how that could be compromising to people's safety?

Every company has some ridiculous unobtainable mission statement. This isn't a bad goal in isolation, but it doesn't exist in isolation. Capitalism works best if you pretend it does though, and ignore the horrors it creates around you. "Ram your way to the top and ignore the other humans you negatively affect with your decisions and you'll be successful or something like that. Above all, think of yourself first, and others second, if at all." What a sad way to live.


## Motif

If you've read this far and have been living on Earth in 2020, the motif here is pretty clear: **it's all about people**. Physical isolation has driven discourse towards isolated echo chambers. It's easy to avoid self-reflection when you're surrounded by people who agree with your every thought. Self-reflection is uncomfortable because it requires admitting to yourself that you're doing something wrong. You can't deflect and self-reflect. Self-reflection is meaningless without change. But when the upside is _actually_ making humanity better, why avoid it?
